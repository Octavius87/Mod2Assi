    <p>The bread is hollowed out, filled first with a layer of seasoned french fries, then topped with optional layers of sauce, cheese, egg, and meat. The multi-layered sandwich is packed into an instantly-recognizable white plastic sack.
	Tip: compress the sandwich together while it's still inside the bag; otherwise you've got a mess of food that you couldn't get either your hands or your mouth around..</p>

  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12" id="container"><p>Grab 5 to 6 ounces of meat and lightly toss from hand to hand, forming a ball.The patty should be at least as wide as your bun and about 3/4 to 1 inch thick.Make a divot in the middle of the burger with your thumb to help it keep its shape while cooking. and season them again with salt and pepper. Put the burgers on the grill and let them be. The less touching, the better the burger. For a juicier burger, resist the urge to press down. Cover the grill.It's time to flip when the burger releases from the grate without sticking, To add cheese, move the burgers to the cooler side of the grill, top with cheese and cover the grill for a minute to let the cheese melt!.</p>
